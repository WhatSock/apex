Description: Behavioral properties control the dynamic behaviors of DC objects.

Note: Each property may be set declaratively when creating new DC objects, or directly by modifying individual properties on instantiated DC objects.

Declarative Syntax

{
  PropertyName1: Value1,
  PropertyName2: Value2
  // Etc.
}

Direct Syntax

var Value = DC.PropertyName;

DC.PropertyName = Value;

DC Object Properties

Note: The displayed value for each property represents its default value when omitted.

  // Prevent the DC object from rendering.
  isDisabled: false

  // Automatically invoke DC.render() when the DC object is instantiated.
  // Will not render if isDisabled is set to true.
  autoRender: false

  // Convey beginning and ending boundary information to screen reader users.
  // Causes a named region to be created when rendered.
  // Requires DC.role be set to an informative name, which will become the name for the region.
  exposeBounds: false

  // Assigns an informative name to convey the purpose of the DC object when rendered.
  // This is required if exposeBounds is set to true, and if ariaLabelledby is set to false.
  role: ""

  // Explicitly assigns an informative name to convey the purpose of the DC object when rendered by referencing the ID of the triggering element.
  // This does not require that the role property be set.
  ariaLabelledby: false

  // Explicitly set the triggering element to reference the rendered DC object as being controlled by the triggering element.
  ariaControls: false

  // Automatically announce the textual content of the DC object when rendered.
  announce: false

  // Prevent the same content from being announced repeatedly when announce is set to true.
  noRepeat: false

  // Fire a system-wide alert to announce the DC content when announce is set to true.
  isAlert: false

  // Expose an offscreen positioned Close link for screen reader users.
  exposeHiddenClose: false

  // Visually display the offscreen Close link when it receives keyboard focus
  displayHiddenClose: true

  // Assign link text for the offscreen Close link when rendered.
  hiddenCloseName: "Close"

  // Set a control type name for an interactive widget.
  // This is used when creating widget type profiles to establish common properties for similare widget templates.
  // View help for the 4X API $A.addWidgetProfile() function for more details.
  widgetType: ""

  // Automatically close the widget DC object when another widget of a different widget type is opened.
  // Requires that widgetType is set to a widget type name.
  // Auto-closing only occurs when a different DC object including a different widgetType name is opened.
  // Auto-closing does not occur when another widget of the same widget type is opened.
  autoCloseWidget: false

  // Automatically close the widget DC object when another widget of the same widget type is opened.
  // Requires that widgetType is set to a widget type name.
  // Auto-closing only occurs when a different DC object including the same widgetType name is opened.
  // Auto-closing does not occur when another widget of a different widget type is opened.
  autoCloseSameWidget: false

  // Specify that the collection of sibling DC objects will function as independant objects, where multiple DC objects may be open at the same time.
  allowMultiple: true

  // Specify that the currently open DC object can be rerendered, which will cause all related lifecycle methods to exicute as though DC.remove() and DC.render() were separatly invoked.
  // If not enabled, nothing will happen when attempting to rerender a DC object that is already open.
  allowRerender: false

  // Automatically make the DC object focusable when rendered.
  isFocusable: false

  // Specify that the DC object must receive focus as soon as the object is rendered.
  forceFocus: false

  // Specify that the first active element within the DC object must receive focus when dc.focus() is called.
  forceFocusWithin: true

  // Specify that pressing the Escape key within the DC object will cause it to close.
  escToClose: false

  // Specify that the collection of sibling DC objects will function like tabs, where only one can be opened at a time.
  // No ARIA attributes are added as part of this functionality; these must be added separately if desired.
  // View the TabList module for creating client-side TabList widgets with proper ARIA markup.
  isTab: false

  // Specify that the collection of sibling DC objects will function like toggles, where the currently open DC object can be closed.
  // No ARIA attributes are added as part of this functionality; these must be added separately if desired.
  isToggle: false

  // Set a lock on the DC object to maintain its current state.
  // Locking a DC object when currently open makes the object impossible to close, nor can it be opened if it is locked in its closed state.
  lock: false

  // Specify that the triggering element, if present, will receive focus as soon as the associated DC object is closed.
  returnFocus: true

  // Optionally override returnFocus and send focus to a different element after the DC object closes.
  // Rerouting focus is a temporary behavior, where the property will clear itself after rerouting is complete.
  // Property supports a DOM node or CSS selector.
  rerouteFocus: null

  // Specify that the newly rendered content will be scrolled into view automatically after it is rendered.
  // May include a boolean value, or a function to perform a custom scroll action using any method.
scrollIntoView: false

Or

scrollIntoView: function(DC, containerElement) {
  // Scroll containerElement into view.
}

  // Specify that keyboard tabbing is confined within the DC object container element when pressing Tab and Shift+Tab between active elements.
circularTabbing: false
