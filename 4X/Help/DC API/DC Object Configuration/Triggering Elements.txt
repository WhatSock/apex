Description: Triggering element properties control the assignment and behaviors of DC object triggering elements.

Note: Each property must be set declaratively when creating new DC objects, otherwise event bindings will not be created when the DC object is instantiated.

Declarative Syntax

{
  PropertyName1: Value1,
  PropertyName2: Value2
  // Etc.
}

Note: The displayed value for each property represents its default value when omitted.

When 'on' is set to "click", and 'trigger' references an element that is not keyboard focusable, it will automatically become keyboard accessible and include a valid role of "button" for non-sighted screen reader users. All triggering elements must include unique and informative names to ensure accessibility.

DC Object Properties

// Set one or more triggering elements for a DC object.
// The 'trigger' property may reference a DOM element, or reference one or more elements using a CSS selector.
// When a DC object is rendered after a triggering element is activated, the triggering element DOM node can be accessed using the DC.triggerNode property.
  trigger: ""

// Manually set a different DOM element to insert a DC object after when rendered.
// This is for addressing issues when a DC object cannot be practically inserted after the triggering element.
// So, instead, 'targetObj' will pretend to be the triggering element for the purpose of DOM insertion.
  targetObj: null

// Set one or more event bindings to trigger the opening process of a DC object.
// All event bindings specified using the 'on' property are bound to the triggering element specified declaratively using the 'trigger' property.
// Individual events must be added using just the name of the event in lowercase: "click"
// Or, multiple events may be added by seperating each with a space: "click focus"
// Additionally, the 'on' property may consist of a key value map of event:handler syntax declarations.
// The associated DC object is always passed through to the event handler as the second argument.
  on: ""

Or

on: {
  click: function(event, DC) {
    // Do stuff, then render the DC object.
    DC.render();
  },
  focus: function(event, DC) {
    // Do stuff, then render the DC object.
    DC.render();
  }
}

Example 1: Set a triggering element with a basic click handler to open.

{
  id: "UniqueID1",
  trigger: "button.login",
  on: "click"
}

Example 2: Set a triggering element with multiple events to open.

{
  id: "UniqueID2",
  trigger: "button.help-tooltip",
  on: "click focus"
}
