Description: Content properties configure the type and source of the content being rendered.

Note: Each property may be set declaratively when creating new DC objects, or directly by modifying individual properties on instantiated DC objects.

Declarative Syntax

{
  PropertyName1: Value1,
  PropertyName2: Value2
  // Etc.
}

Direct Syntax

var Value = DC.PropertyName;

DC.PropertyName = Value;

DC Object Properties

Note: The displayed value for each property represents its default value when omitted.

// Suppress the automatic addition of extra div elements around the source when rendered.
// Extra divs are added to create accessibility support for widgets and complex interactive structures.
// For simple structures that don't require these however, these can be suppressed so that only the source is rendered.
// Important: Must not be plain text, valid elements are required since event bindings will be applied to the source element container.
  sourceOnly: true

// Set the mode to determine the type of the content being rendered.
// 0 = DC.source includes DOM elements or source code to be rendered directly.
// 1 = perform Load function where DC.fetch.url includes an external resource url, and DC.fetch.data is also configured as needed.
// 2 = perform Get function where DC.fetch.url includes an external resource url, DC.fetch.data is also configured, and content must be manually added to DC.source within the Fetch Success callback.
  mode: 0

// The source content to load within the DC object when rendered.
// When mode=0, markup strings or DOM nodes can be set as DC.source.
// When mode=1 or 2, DC.source must be populated from the success callback after a Fetch API call is made using DC.fetch.url.
  source: ""

// Fetch API configuration within the DC object.
  fetch: {
    // Resource URL.
    url: "",
    data: {
      // Return type options: "text", "html", "xml", "json"
      returnType: "html",
      // CSS selector to parse markup content when loaded into the Success callback function. (Relevant for returnType html or xml)
      selector: ""
    },
    success: function(content, promise, DC) {
      // Explicitly set the content to be rendered visually.
      DC.source = content;
    },
    error: function(errorMsg, promise, DC) {   }
  }

Example 1: Mode 0 with markup string

{
  id: "UniqueID1",
  source: '<b> Tooltip text. </b>'
}

Example 2: Mode 1 with resource URL plus selector to filter returned content

{
  id: "UniqueID2",
  mode: 1,
  fetch: {
    url: "https://server/resource?params",
    data: {
      returnType: "html",
      selector: "#help-tooltip-id"
    },
    success: function(content, promise, DC) {
      // Optionally do stuff after specified content is pulled in prior to rendering.
      // Then explicitly set the content to be rendered.
      DC.source = content;
    }
  }
}
