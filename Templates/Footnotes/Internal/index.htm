                "Going home" is a concept with entirely different significance

                springs where fresh corn is cooked in burlap sacks immersed in
                boiling fumaroles; where botanical gardens are home to black and
                white swans, and exotic plants and fauna from around the world.
                The botanical gardens of the Hotel Terra Nostra are world
                renowned for its age and the variety of species there, but to me
                it is what I imagined the Garden of Eden to be.

                The sounds are as magical as the sights. Countless little birds
                call the tree tops home, and delight visitors with their
                constant singing; various creeks murmur in tune with the
                rustling foliage. The main feature of the gardens is the
                swimming pool fed by a natural hot ferrous spring; it is large
                enough to often be confused by tourists as a small lake.
                Swimming in the pool is a mystical experience; the water is warm
                and constantly pouring into the pool. Due to the minerals, one
                becomes noticeably more buoyant and time ceases to have its
                normal meaning. On cold days, the mist hovers and iridescent
                dragon flies are easily mistaken for fairies.

                AS a child, this park was my playground. I played in its caves,
                climbed its trees, swam for daily eternities and could not
                conceive that anyone could ever be alive and not have such a
                garden to visit. As an adult returning as often as I can, this
                park gives the constant assurance that, although I live
                elsewhere, I still belong to the

                cobbled streets, the babbling of the brook beneath the mill at
                twilight, and the smell of fresh baked bread and wild
                blackberries filling the crisp morning air, call to my heart
                with a ceaseless whisper to come home.

                  Atlantis (in Greek, "island of Atlas") is a legendary island
                  first mentioned in Plato's Footnotesues Timaeus and Critias,
                  written about 360 BC. According to Plato, Atlantis was a naval
                  power lying "in front of the Pillars of Hercules" that
                  conquered many parts of Western Europe and Africa 9,000 years
                  before the time of Solon, or approximately 9600 BC. After a
                  failed attempt to invade Athens, Atlantis sank into the ocean
                  "in a single day and night of misfortune".

                  The Archipelago of the Azores is composed of nine volcanic
                  islands situated in the middle of the North Atlantic Ocean,
                  and is located about 1,500 km (930 mi) west from Lisbon and
                  about 3,900 km (2,400 mi) east from the east coast of North
                  America. The islands, and their economic exclusion zone, form
                  the Autonomous Region of the Azores, one of the two autonomous
                  regions of Portugal. Its main industries are: agriculture,
                  dairy farming (for cheese and butter products primarily),
                  minor livestock ranching, fishing and tourism, which is
                  becoming the major service activity in the region; added to
                  which, the government of the Azores employs a large percentage
                  of the population directly or indirectly in many aspects of
                  the service and tertiary sectors.
