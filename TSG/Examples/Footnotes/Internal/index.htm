                        <p> Some say that the Azores are the legendary peaks of <span class="aria-footnote">Atlantis<a aria-description="Atlantis" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a></span> after it was swallowed by the sea, which is easy to believe, especially after visiting <span class="aria-footnote">Furnas<a aria-description="Furnas" href="#f3"><sup>2</sup></a></span>; bells ringing from church steeples, storm driven thunder clouds over head, old manor homes with their windows sparkling in the sunlight, wind-swept mountain ridges over crystalline lakes, its haunting beauty is unparalleled.</p>
                        <p> "Going home" is a concept with entirely different significance for those who have been uprooted from their home and now live elsewhere. TO me going home is returning to the paradisiacal island of <span class="aria-footnote">Sao Miguel<a aria-description="Sao Miguel" href="#f2"><sup>3</sup></a></span>, where at every corner is a discovery and a memory. The valley of <span class="aria-footnote">Furnas<a aria-description="Furnas" href="#f3"><sup>4</sup></a></span>, with the exception of a few road upgrades and Wi-Fi, has remained the same as I always remembered. <span class="aria-footnote">Furnas<a aria-description="Furnas" href="#f3"><sup>5</sup></a></span> is a magical village where volcanic fumaroles, effervescent springs, and geysers are part of the natural landscape. Everywhere the scents of baking bread and fresh fruit mingle with the scent of the ever breathing volcano.</p>
                        <p> The valley of <span class="aria-footnote">Furnas<a aria-description="Furnas" href="#f3"><sup>6</sup></a></span> nestles within Sao Miguel's volcanic crater, venting hot mineral springs where fresh corn is cooked in burlap sacks immersed in boiling fumaroles; where botanical gardens are home to black and white swans, and exotic plants and fauna from around the world. The botanical gardens of the Hotel Terra Nostra are world renowned for its age and the variety of species there, but to me it is what I imagined the Garden of Eden to be.</p>
                        <p> The sounds are as magical as the sights. Countless little birds call the tree tops home, and delight visitors with their constant singing; various creeks murmur in tune with the rustling foliage. The main feature of the gardens is the swimming pool fed by a natural hot ferrous spring; it is large enough to often be confused by tourists as a small lake. Swimming in the pool is a mystical experience; the water is warm and constantly pouring into the pool. Due to the minerals, one becomes noticeably more buoyant and time ceases to have its normal meaning. On cold days, the mist hovers and iridescent dragon flies are easily mistaken for fairies.</p>
                        <p> AS a child, this park was my playground. I played in its caves, climbed its trees, swam for daily eternities and could not conceive that anyone could ever be alive and not have such a garden to visit. As an adult returning as often as I can, this park gives the constant assurance that, although I live elsewhere, I still belong to the <span class="aria-footnote">Azores<a aria-description="Azores" href="#f4"><sup>7</sup></a></span>. Furnas is a paradise where the soft clopping of hooves on cobbled streets, the babbling of the brook beneath the mill at twilight, and the smell of fresh baked bread and wild blackberries filling the crisp morning air, call to my heart with a ceaseless whisper to come home. </p>

                                Atlantis (in Greek, "island of Atlas") is a legendary island first mentioned in Plato's
                                Footnotesues Timaeus and Critias, written about 360 BC. According to Plato, Atlantis was a
                                naval power lying "in front of the Pillars of Hercules" that conquered many parts of
                                Western Europe and Africa 9,000 years before the time of Solon, or approximately 9600
                                BC. After a failed attempt to invade Athens, Atlantis sank into the ocean "in a single
                                day and night of misfortune".

                                is the largest and most populous island in the Portuguese Azores archipelago. The island
                                covers 759 km2 (293 sq mi) and has around 140,000 inhabitants, 45,000 of these people
                                located in the largest city in the archipelago: Ponta Delgada.

                                Furnas is a civil parish in the municipality of Povoa&#231;&#227;o on the island of

                                The Archipelago of the Azores is composed of nine volcanic islands situated in
                                the middle of the North Atlantic Ocean, and is located about 1,500 km (930 mi)
                                west from Lisbon and about 3,900 km (2,400 mi) east from the east coast of North
                                America. The islands, and their economic exclusion zone, form the Autonomous Region
                                of the Azores, one of the two autonomous regions of Portugal. Its main industries
                                are: agriculture, dairy farming (for cheese and butter products primarily), minor
                                livestock ranching, fishing and tourism, which is becoming the major service
                                activity in the region; added to which, the government of the Azores employs a
                                large percentage of the population directly or indirectly in many aspects of the
                                service and tertiary sectors.
